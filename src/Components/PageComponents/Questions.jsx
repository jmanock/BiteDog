        <h2>What is a canine liability policy?</h2>
        <p>It is a standalone policy that covers injuries or damages which are caused by your dog. Most people think only of dog bites; however, bites are just one reason people are suing dog owners. If your dog scratches, scares, causes a person to fall or if your dog injures another animal, it is likely you will hear from a lawyer. Coverage is provided on and off your premises anywhere in the United States. Many landlords and municpalities are requesting to be added as "Additional Insureds" providing them with liability coverage for injuries or damages caused by your dog and so they can be notified of any changes or cancellations.</p>

          We are willing to review all dogs. You will be asked to give us information on the incident or incidents leading to the label. If your quote comes back as a "referral", that means the underwriters want to review your application closer. You will receive the final decision in a separate email.
