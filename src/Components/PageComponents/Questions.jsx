        <h3 id='allBreeds'>Do you cover all breeds?</h3>
        <p>Yes, we cover all breeds, including those normally considered dangerous such as Pit Bulls, Rottweilers, German Shepherds, Saint Bernard's Great Danes, Dobermans and Huskies, whether pure or mixed breeds</p>
        <h3 id='howTo'>How do I do this?</h3>
        <p>This is policy is just like any other policy, you get your quote, decide if you want to purchase and conclude the process. This is a FULLY automated program, it is designed to be easy, quick and convenient. It is also the reason the premium is less than most other policies.</p>
        <h3 id='whatIs'>What is a canine liability policy?</h3>
        <p>It is a standalone policy that covers injuries or damages which are caused by your dog. Most people think only of dog bites; however, bites are just one reason people are suing dog owners. If your dog scratches, scares, causes a person to fall or if your dog injures another animal, it is likely you will hear from a lawyer. Coverage is provided on and off your premises anywhere in the United States. Many landlords and municpalities are requesting to be added as "Additional Insureds" providing them with liability coverage for injuries or damages caused by your dog and so they can be notified of any changes or cancellations.</p>
        <h3 id='howTo'>How do I get a quote?</h3>

        <h3 id='paymentPlans'>Do you have payment plans?</h3>
        <p>
          Payment options and plans will vary depending on the amount of the premium they will appear on the page with your quote. That <span className='bold'>QUOTE</span> you will reveive is for an annual policy which is 12 months or one year. All payments must be received and authorized by either a debit or credit card processing company. The charges will appear on your statement from "Dual Commercial" they are assisting us. The only Rip Off reports about the program are the result of cancellation due to nonpayment of premiums, only the Insurer can reinstate coverage we do not have the authority to without their approval. <span className='bold'>There is no Deductible!</span>
        </p>
        <h3 id='limits'>What Limits are Available?</h3>
        <p>
          We have four options for coverage $25,000, $50,000, $100,000 and $300,000. At this time we are unable to assist with higher limits such as $500,000 and up.

        <h3 id='behaviorHistory'>What if my Dog has a behavior history or has been labeled dangerous by a governing body?</h3>
        <p>
          We are willing to review all dogs. You will be asked to give us information on the incident or incidents leading to the label. If your quote comes back as a "referral", that means the underwriters want to review your application closer. You will receive the final decision in a separate email.
        </p>
        <h3 id='dogComesWork'>I need coverage because my dog works with me or comes to work with me.</h3>
        <p>
          If your dog goes to work with you but does not assist you, other than greeting customers or visiting with staff or employees, we can include coverage.
        </p>
        <h3 id='dogIntegral'>I need coverage because my dog is integral or involved in my work.</h3>
        <p>
          If you use your dog in your line of work and consider it to be "Involved" or "Integral" we can provide coverage. For example, many dogs are used in certain lines of work to sniff out bombs, drugs, bed bugs, physical therapy or counseling.

        <h3 id='additionalInsured'>What is an "Additional Insured"?</h3>
        <p>
          You may be asked to name your landlord, employer, a governmental entity or other interested parties on the policy in the event your dog injures someone or causes damage. You may add one or more, but your must have their name, address, and contact information (either phone or e-mail). There is a $50 charge per separate address to add them to your policy. You do not need to add a spouse, significant other or family member as an "Additional Insured", if they reside at the same address as you, as they are already covered under the policy.

        <p>
          This coverage is available through the Excess and Surplus marketplace. These types of policies are often called non-admitted or non-licensed. The primary difference between this policy and an admitted policy is that if the insurance company were to go out of business, there would be no protection under your State Guaranty Fund.

        <p>
          All installments will be drawn directly from the debit or credit card uses to purchase the policy without action by you.
